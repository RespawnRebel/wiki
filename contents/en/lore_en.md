<h1>Backstory</h1>
<p>Within hive cities where black smoke seeps through corroded streets, in claustrophobic and hostile void communes, in isolated colonies  — that is where Man lives. The remnant of a once-great civilization, now clinging by a thread to what little they hold after the Split. In a miniscule nook amidst the vast empty galaxy, witheld from unlocking the secrets of our past, Man's struggle against itself continues eternally. Corporations devour their rivals, planetary factions fight for priceless resources, enigmatic guilds weave webs of intrigue as they politic and quarrel. Some would say we've learned nothing, and damned to suffer the folly of our forebears. Others say that only barely holding on to everything is humanity fated to exist foreveromore.
<p>And yet still humanity survives. We unearthed xeno empires eons in age, this encouraging man to pursue their ambitions to settle the stars, the far-off lights we impotently observed for millenia ripe for the taking. A Golden Age of colonization awaited... And yet our hunger for more was never sated..</p>
<p>In the year 2343, a vessel departs to the declining territories of the Alliance of Humanity, once a great empire, half the Milky Way beneath its steel boot. None can say for certain what killed the freighter. Or even whom. But a derilicit hulk reached the original intended destination months behind schedule, hull shattered by a weapon of unbelievable might — more disturbingly reality itself appeared to collapsed within its confines, the rare 'survivor' encountered no longer truly human. 
A patch-job and a semi-thorough cleansing of the less-friendly entities that inhabited the cruiser was enough for the Alliance to declare her spaceworthy once more. Even if the aura of strange and bizarre incidents persists unhindered. The crew of this odd ship contains a massive variety of characters: biologists and psychologists, anarcho-engineers, PMCs possesing personal arsenals of Colony-destroying proportions, operatives from all sorts of agencies, smugglers, draft-dodging scoundrels and pickpocketing rogues… And it just so happens you're a member of this motley brigade.</p>
Welcome aboard.</p>
